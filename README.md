# My-Color-Recognizer
Hi! My name is Leena Ganta. For my NVIDIA project with the Jetson Nano, I decided to create a color recognizer. The point of this project is to aid people who are color blind. 
How this works, is you will point the camera at an object, and then the color recognizer will tell you what color the object is!
